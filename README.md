STICK NO BILLS™ Font
===================


STICK NO BILLS - was developed as the bespoke Libre typeface of [Stick No Bills™ Poster Gallery](http://sticknobillsonline.com/) in Galle, Sri Lanka. Now with financial support from Google Mooniak is expanding it to multiple weights and multi script support.


The first drawings were developed by Martyn Hodges for uppercase and numerals and mooniak is working on further refining and developing them into a font.

See our [blog post](http://blog.mooniak.com/tagged/sticknobillsfont) on the process.
